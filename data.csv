"When pure power meets efficentcy! it is AMAZING!","The only thing I don't like is the size but considering the power it isn't a deal breaker. Had to get a riser and GPU mount ""mount hasn't came yet"". But I'm running on a hp with only a proprietary psu that only is available in500watt but since the CPU is i5 10400 and ssds are so efficient I have no problems running it, 286watts for the sheer power this thing is awesome, making it possible for my PC to do things it could never do because of power resrictions. Had to use a GPU calculator but it was right. Pcie 4x isn't nessassary but couldn't hurt. Upgrading from a 3060ti this thing was Soo worth it! Don't listen to the hate, and Dlss 3 is great but I barely needed Dlss cause this can do it without it 4k, but the Nvidia frame regeneration option with these 40series is no exaggeration, seriously double fps without sweating.  Plus it came with red fall when I purchased it.. seriously love this card. Super sturdy. If anyone is hating on it its because they messed up and picked up a different one.","05 Apr 2023","Style: RTX 4070 TI OC","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61PFy8Bx2PL._SY88.jpg","Yes","MrDanglez","5.0","ASUS TUF Gaming NVIDIA GeForce RTX™ 4070 Ti OC Edition Gaming Graphics Card (PCIe 4.0, 12GB GDDR6X, HDMI 2.1a, DisplayPort 1.4a)","https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-Gaming-GeForce-Graphics-DisplayPort/product-reviews/B0BQTSV2GG/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Good card, just not a 4080 they tried to call it","3090ti performance for way less money made possible by nvidia trying to name it 4080 12gb.  Under 1k for the performance it offers is pretty good these days.  I was also very willing to pay a little more for the asus branding.  It's a very rigid, good looking card.","11 Feb 2023","Style: RTX 4070 TI OC","","Yes","michael m","4.0","ASUS TUF Gaming NVIDIA GeForce RTX™ 4070 Ti OC Edition Gaming Graphics Card (PCIe 4.0, 12GB GDDR6X, HDMI 2.1a, DisplayPort 1.4a)","https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-Gaming-GeForce-Graphics-DisplayPort/product-reviews/B0BQTSV2GG/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews

"Works as desired","Out of the box and into my build it simply works. Updating the BIOS was fairly simple. It's all up to date and my newly built computer works. Best and latest games play. Old games play. It's all good. I'm not thrilled with the cost of graphics cards but it is what it is. If you need one get the best you can. It was the only computer part that came from a third party seller and that seller was prompt and the graphics card arrived safely, well packaged.","11 Feb 2023","Style: RTX 4070 TI OC","","Yes","gadlaw","5.0","ASUS TUF Gaming NVIDIA GeForce RTX™ 4070 Ti OC Edition Gaming Graphics Card (PCIe 4.0, 12GB GDDR6X, HDMI 2.1a, DisplayPort 1.4a)","https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-Gaming-GeForce-Graphics-DisplayPort/product-reviews/B0BQTSV2GG/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews
